# D8starter
D8starter, as its name implies, is a [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/download "Download Drupal 8") starter theme with [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap • The world's most popular mobile-first and responsive front-end framework."), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/ "gulp.js"), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets") and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/ "Font Awesome, the iconic font and CSS toolkit"), all included.

## What do you need?

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Download Node.js")
2. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com "gulp.js")

## Usage

1. Using your native terminal/console, go to your desired directory and clone this repository:
> `git clone https://github.com/kwegiel/d8starter.git`

2. Change to the newly downloaded directory:
> `cd d8starter`

3. Use the node package manager to finish the installation:
> `npm install`

3. You're (almost) ready to go. Get Gulp to “watch” your Sass files so that they are automatically compiled to CSS when saved:
> `gulp watch`
